# RecordStore
This project is an example of a form-based solution to facilitate the tracking and review of records or forms. It is scaffolded with the Angular CLI (as we can see below). In order to run, add a config.js file with applicapable database connections and credentials. Within the server directory is the code for a basic node server and the associate routes for CRUD operations. The forms are styled with Angular Material and the landing page is Bootstrap.
